## 2.1 - Core services
### Explanation
Services the SIRT should offer. Organize by core/optional, year 1/year N?

### Key steps and milestones

#### More predictable
- Integrate results of Section 1 survey (1 month)

Develop internal SIRT procedures for services ~6 weeks

External facing guidance for services ~3 weeks

Testing period (tabletop some services/procedures/guidance through past incidents) ~2 weeks




#### Less predictable
Responding to incidents (handling incidents, events, cases) is significantly driven by external forces. This is still somewhat predictable, but has significant variability. Milestones include:

- Estimate incident distribution, consider adh work, "t-shirt sizing"
- Decide distribution of incidents SIRT expects to work on and resource needs
- Decide selection criteria (intake, triage, accceptance)
- Decide resource estimates per case type and frequency

For diversity, reslience, quality (and possibly other reasons), roughly expect 3-7 individuals per incident, with ideally 2 as an absolute minimum.

Recommend core services for year 1

Support acceptably secure communications

Coordinate and negotiate vulnerability disclosures among stakeholders

Stakeholders include:

* Maintainers, developers, suppliers, vendors
* Researchers, reporters
* Users

SIRT mission/ROE should include such things (move this up SIRT SIG) ~3 hours

  * Public safety organizations, community at large, the world are a subset of users, not a direct stakeholder consideration?
  * are there legal/regulatory reporting concerns? --> OpenSSF (Art does not think there are :)
  * a comment somewhere (possibly higher up around a mission statement?) that offensive users of vulnerabilities are *not* a specfied stakeholder? The SIRT is the bluest of blue teams? Any other specific non-stakeholders?

Coordination includes:

* Notifications to other parties
* Timelines, particularly public disclosure
* Information management (strive to provide consistent and accurate information)
 * Write or assist in writing advisories, vulnerability catalog entries (CVE, GVSD, osv.dev), release notes, and other vulnerability documentation, focusing on assessment and actions needed by users

Vulnerability assessment

This is not optional, the SIRT must at least perform sufficent assessment to determine whether or not to engage (see triage/engagement).

(optional) The SIRT can experiment with providing subject matter experts (SME) to help with vetting and offering security expertise in order to help maintainers better understand the vulnerabilities and their impact. Both technological (e.g., PoC) and broader risk aspects (ubiquity, supply chain impact, likelihood, etc.).

(optional) Review proposed fixes before they are public to see if they fully resolve the reported vulnerabilities (related to technological assessment/PoC).

(optional) Assist in creation, review, testing of proposed fixes.
 
For year one, the SIRT will provide guidance and best practices documentation to maintainers on how to evaluate vulnerability reports in their open source project and react to zero-day exploitation reports.  Part of this is covered in 2.1 and 1.3

For year two (actual time: all the stacked prep time, section 1.*, 2.1, etc) and later, we will expand and start helping to evaluate and assist maintainers receiving reports of novel vulnerabilities and in-the-wild exploitation of vulnerabilities in their open source project. Depends on 1.3

(dicsuss) Suggestion to provide response services right away (year 1), this is perhaps the question of balance between education and more direct response service (education is also a service).

### Time and resources estimate
This is going to be somewhat tricky.

Produce X educational/guidance materials is easy to estimate.

Direct response service is harder and depends on a number of inputs, including external events that are hard to precisely predict.

* What response sevices does the SIRT offer?
* What kinds of events do those services support?
* How many events of which type will occur?
* How many events will the SIRT take on?
* Availability of resources, paid and volunteer

This is a typical problem for emergency response activities, e.g., EMT resources are idle a lot (well not really, they train, prepare, patrol, etc.) but when a big event happens, you don't want to find out you're 50% short-staffed. Volunteer EMT models seem to work, but require the volunteers to be ready and committed to step in when needed.

overflow and underflow of resource needs

* ability to quickly staff up, call OpenSSF/LF members for volunteers, expect 10-12 hours of onboarding time
* In SIRT terms, staff can work on relatively lower priority cases or projects but be prepared to switch to high priority cases when needed, volunteers can return to their day jobs

per case/event/incident resource estimates TBD, related to service choices, expected distribution, intake/criteria

expectation: some core/FT staff, at least program management, expect volunteer responders


## 2.2 Engagement model

### Explanation

Depends heavily on Core services (2.1)

### Key steps and milestones

Estimate operational case distribution for at least first year (~1 month calendar time)

Complete Core services (2.1)

Develop and document processes to perform services

- Includes Engagement criteria (2.4)
- To the extent possible, publish processes
- Playbooks
- Service level expectations (not strict SLOs)
- Includes intake, initial assessment (triage), engagement criteria evaluation (2.4), service selection, assignment, performance of services, tracking/management, closure, reporting, and review
- Determine intake routes, availability, and service level expectations
 - 24/7 coverage? In which time zones? 

Develop and publish documentation for external parties (~1 month calendar time)

 - "How to" engage with the SIRT
 - Service offerings and expectations

Decide SIRT event documetation processes and outputs (e.g., advisory, blog post, mailing list, submission to catalogs like GSD and CVE)

- Research documentation/publication options (~2 weeks calendar time)
- Test (~2 weeks calendar time)
- Integrate with project/maintainer security documentation and publication processes

Determine tools and infrastructure needed

Determine training

Research existing OSS security mechanisms (~1 month calendar time)

 - Contact and integrate as appropriate
 - Examples: oss-security, distros, OSS foundations, OSS hosting/infrastructure providers (yes like GitHub)

Consider EMT staffing models?

Determine legal issues, seek advice (from LF/OpenSSF)

Develop volunteer requirements

 - eth

define volunteering processes & rules, the upholding of commitments upheld by incident responders (including preventing premature disclosure “How-to” guides for those maintainers/developers wishing to engage with the SIRT), service level agreements (SLAs), and the definition a process fore engagement/interactions with Distros, & oss-security & existing security teams.

## 2.3 Staffing requirements
### Explanation
How to staff the SIRT, including volunteer management

Depends on/relates to: 2.1, 2.2

Part of the staffing requirements are influenced by selection of services and expected distribution of incidents.

Staff (including volunteers) will be expected to follow rules of engagement and a code of conduct, to include separating OSS SIRT membership and activities from other employer interests. This is covered more in Section 3.

### Key steps and milestones
Determine staffing structure (~1 month calendar time)

- Some paid full or part-time staff
- Significant proportion of volunteer staff
- Flexibility to spin volunteer staff up or down depending on case distribution
- Legal and contractual volunteer issues and agreements

Develop volunteer vetting process (~1 month calendar time)

Develop ethics and code of conduct (~1 month calendar time)

Develop sets of required and wanted skills and experience to match Services (2.1) and expected case distribution (2.2) (~2 weeks calendar time)

- Estimate number of volunteer staff with skill and experience sets

Determine training requrements and options (~1 month calendar time)

 - Training staff to better perform services, separate from SIRT onboarding and process training

Develop onboarding program (~1 month calendar time)

Develop outreach and recruiting plan (~1 month calendar time)

Perform the first onboarding (~2 weeks calendar time)

Meet estimated number of staff with appropriate skills and experience sets


Document staff requirements for 1-2 year’s worth of goals

Compensation, incentive, and funding model (as appropriate), w. With a focus on defining compensation and incentives for incident responders as appropriate. Look at f, funding for tooling, compute, and governance. DWe will describe the support staff and comms, and also cover the benefits and guidelines for organizations “donating” staff.
