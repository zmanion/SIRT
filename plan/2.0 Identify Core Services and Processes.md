Recommend core services for year 1

Support acceptably secure communications

Coordinate and negotiate vulnerability disclosures among stakeholders

Stakeholders include:

* Maintainers, developers, suppliers, vendors
* Researchers, reporters
* Users

SIRT mission/ROE should include such things (move this up SIRT SIG) ~3 hours

  * Public safety organizations, community at large, the world are a subset of users, not a direct stakeholder consideration?
  * are there legal/regulatory reporting concerns? --> OpenSSF (Art does not think there are :)
  * a comment somewhere (possibly higher up around a mission statement?) that offensive users of vulnerabilities are *not* a specfied stakeholder? The SIRT is the bluest of blue teams? Any other specific non-stakeholders?

Coordination includes:

* Notifications to other parties
* Timelines, particularly public disclosure
* Information management (strive to provide consistent and accurate information)
 * Write or assist in writing advisories, vulnerability catalog entries (CVE, GVSD, osv.dev), release notes, and other vulnerability documentation, focusing on assessment and actions needed by users

Vulnerability assessment

This is not optional, the SIRT must at least perform sufficent assessment to determine whether or not to engage (see triage/engagement).

(optional) The SIRT can experiment with providing subject matter experts (SME) to help with vetting and offering security expertise in order to help maintainers better understand the vulnerabilities and their impact. Both technological (e.g., PoC) and broader risk aspects (ubiquity, supply chain impact, likelihood, etc.).

(optional) Review proposed fixes before they are public to see if they fully resolve the reported vulnerabilities (related to technological assessment/PoC).

(optional) Assist in creation, review, testing of proposed fixes.
 
For year one, the SIRT will provide guidance and best practices documentation to maintainers on how to evaluate vulnerability reports in their open source project and react to zero-day exploitation reports.  Part of this is covered in 2.1 and 1.3

For year two (actual time: all the stacked prep time, section 1.*, 2.1, etc) and later, we will expand and start helping to evaluate and assist maintainers receiving reports of novel vulnerabilities and in-the-wild exploitation of vulnerabilities in their open source project. Depends on 1.3

(dicsuss) Suggestion to provide response services right away (year 1), this is perhaps the question of balance between education and more direct response service (education is also a service).

### Time and resources estimate
This is going to be somewhat tricky.

Produce X educational/guidance materials is easy to estimate.

Direct response service is harder and depends on a number of inputs, including external events that are hard to precisely predict.

* What response sevices does the SIRT offer?
* What kinds of events do those services support?
* How many events of which type will occur?
* How many events will the SIRT take on?
* Availability of resources, paid and volunteer

This is a typical problem for emergency response activities, e.g., EMT resources are idle a lot (well not really, they train, prepare, patrol, etc.) but when a big event happens, you don't want to find out you're 50% short-staffed. Volunteer EMT models seem to work, but require the volunteers to be ready and committed to step in when needed.

overflow and underflow of resource needs

* ability to quickly staff up, call OpenSSF/LF members for volunteers, expect 10-12 hours of onboarding time
* In SIRT terms, staff can work on relatively lower priority cases or projects but be prepared to switch to high priority cases when needed, volunteers can return to their day jobs

per case/event/incident resource estimates TBD, related to service choices, expected distribution, intake/criteria

expectation: some core/FT staff, at least program management, expect volunteer responders
