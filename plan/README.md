# The Problem:
The next world-altering critical open-source software vulnerability like Heartbleed or
Log4Shell is almost certainly already existing, undiscovered, somewhere in our codebases
today. When these vulnerabilities are eventually discovered by either a friendly researcher
or a malicious threat actor, open-source maintainers need to make quick decisions that
can dramatically impact the cybersecurity posture of entire industries. With this in mind,
it is sobering to realize that in the event of a cybersecurity emergency on an under-re-
sourced project, there is often nowhere to which open-source software maintainers can
turn for well-vetted, highly-available, expert security vulnerability remediation support.
Consequently, developers are suddenly (and sometimes unknowingly) indirectly responsible
for an industry-wide security risk, and have no choice but to try to remediate it alone â€”
often without the specialist security knowledge and coordinated disclosure connections to
do so safely.
